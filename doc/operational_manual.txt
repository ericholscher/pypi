This document is intended for administrators of the python.org host, and
contains information about operationally maintaining the PyPI system.


Maintenance
-----------

The cgi-bin script "pypi.cgi" has a section which should be enabled that
informs the user that the cgi interface is down for maintenance. This is a
simple case of changing the "if 0:" to "if 1:" above the "503" response
line.


Administrative tasks
--------------------

The "admin.py" script will perform several admin tasks (constantly growing
as the need arises):

   password <username> <password>
   rmpackage <package name>
