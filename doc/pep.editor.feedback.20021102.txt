(Surprise!  You probably didn't know I was moonlighting as a deputy PEP
editor. :)

The PEP looks good, Richard.  Some suggestions & questions:

> Title: Distutils Enhancements

Too generic IMO.  How about "Package Index and Metadata for Distutils"?

> The server should be hosted in the python.org domain,

What server?  No server mentioned before this.  Instead of "The
server", perhaps "A package metadata server"?

> hopefully just one command-line command for more regular users.

"hopefully just a one-line command for most users", perhaps?

> The original PEP which proposed such a system

"PEP xxx, the original PEP which proposed such a system"

> The web interface implements the following commands/interfaces:

For readability, I suggest inserting blank lines between definition
list items.  (They blob together now.)

> A demonstration will be available at:

Is it up now?  I wasn't able to access it.  When will it be available?
Couldn't it be hosted on a permanent basis on sf.net (with **TEST**
prominently displayed, of course)?  The previous one at
http://mechanicalcat.net:8081/ is not accessible either.

> two of whom used the register command bo submit package information.
                                        ^^

"bo" should be "to".
