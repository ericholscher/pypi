I've included a public_key in the user schema in anticipation of handling
signing. I've also got a download_url in the package schema - though a
friend has recommended that I have several. I'm not so sure. I _think_ I'd
rather have:

- a definition of download formats for each package (filename, format)
  where
  format is rpm, deb, source gz, source zip, ...
- a definition of download mirrors which give (mirror name, base URL)

and then each mirror can support the same paths starting from their base
URL.

None of this is intended for the initial release though.
