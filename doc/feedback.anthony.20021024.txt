What does this mean?

Why strings like this, rather than proper structures? e.g.

         discriminators = {
             'Development Status': '4 - Beta',
             'Environment'       : ('Console (Text Based)', 'Web Environment')
             'Intended Audience' : ('End Users/Desktop', 'Developers', 'System Administrators'),
.....

How do people know that their trove categorisation is correct (e.g.
that it doesn't have speling mistaiks?)

Should check that this is ok with them.

There should be some sort of simple "check categorisation" or "update
categorisation" thing.

Who can update a package entry? ACLs? How and what can be updated 
with 'register'? Only a new version? What about changing trove 
categorisations, homepages, or the like? What about clashes of 
names (I don't know if there are any out there, but it wouldn't
suprise me).
