for trove, I'd suggest something like a trove browser (but better
than the SF one, pleeeease) that allows you to extract the data for
insertion into your setup.py.
Or else, categorise it via the web, and if you post a new setup.py
register with no discriminators, tell it to leave the current one alone.

you might also want some sort of two-stage "the following things will
be changed, do you want to proceed" thing.
