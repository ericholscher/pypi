Now:

- setup.py fragment allowing use of the classifiers keyword while retaining
  backward compatibility

Later:

- package submission
- change notification emails
- "latest changes"
- admin inteface for user details editing (and fix theller@python.net)
- "does this release supercede the existing release?"
