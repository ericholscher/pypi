Now:

- patch python 2.5 to use the name "Cheese Shop" and the new URL
- PEP for metadata 1.2


Sooner:

- command-line tool to query pypi and fetch entries
- table structure and query support for checking dependencies
  - table structure has columns for identification of the release
    - add a specification ID to release_*?
    - or just use release, name
  - table also has a column for each of <, <=, ==, >=, > so queries are
    easier to form

Later:

- change notification emails
- "latest changes"
- admin inteface for user details editing (and fix theller@python.net)
- "does this release supercede the existing release?"
