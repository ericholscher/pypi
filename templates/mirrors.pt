# PyPI mirrors
#    
# If you want to register a new mirror, send an email
# to the catalog-SIG@python.org with:
#
# - The urls of your mirror:
#   - the root of the server
#   - the index page 
#   - the last modified page
#   - the daily local stats directory
#   - the daily global stats directory
#   - the mirrors page
#
# - The PyPI account name of the maintainer.
#   
#   The registering is done manually and to become a
#   mirror, you need to strictly follow the mirror protocol
#   described here:
#
#    http://wiki.python.org/PEP_374
