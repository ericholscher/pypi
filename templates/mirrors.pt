# PyPI mirrors
#    
# If you want to register a new mirror, send an email
# to the catalog-SIG@python.org with:
#
# - The base url of your mirror.
# - The PyPI account name of the maintainer.
#   
#   The registering is done manually and to become a
#   mirror, you need to strictly follow the mirror protocol
#   described here:
