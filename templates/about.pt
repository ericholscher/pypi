<h1>About</h1>
<p>
Welcome to pypi.python.org, the Python community's software hosting service.
</p>

<p>
Here you'll find a Python package to suit almost any need.
</p>

<p>
The project was started in 2002,
and has since grown to include the contributions of over a dozen Python
programmers, <span tal:content="app/store/count_packages" /> packages
and millions of downloads.
</p>

<p>
The Python Package Index (PyPI) is hosted by the Python Software Foundation (who run the python.org systems) but the project is community-run. Currently there's two maintainers, Richard Jones and Martin von LÃ¶wis.
To contact the admins, please 
use the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=66150&amp;atid=513504">Get help</a>
or
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=66150&amp;atid=513503">Bug reports</a>
links.
</p>

<p>
The index itself is written in Python but pre-dates modern Python web frameworks (<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/CheeseShopDev">more detail</a>).
</p>

<p>
To submit a package use
"<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/CheeseShopTutorial">python setup.py upload</a>"
and to use a package from this index either
"<a href="http://pip.openplans.org/">pip</a> install <i>package</i>"
or download, unpack and "python setup.py install" it.
</p>

<p>
Security: GPG and SSH ... XXX details?
</p>

<p>You can access the data in PyPI from a program using either the per-package
JSON data or the XML-RPC interface.</p>

<p>PyPI now provides a <a href="/mirrors">Mirror infrastructure</a> to allow
users to continue downloading file even if pypi.python.org is unavailable.</p>

<p>
PyPI has also been known as The Python Cheese Shop (and indeed cheeseshop.python.org still works).
</p>

<p>And now for something completely different...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 2em">
<strong>Customer</strong>: Now then, some cheese please, my good man.
<br />
<strong>Owner</strong>: (lustily) Certainly, sir. What would you like?
<br />
<strong>Customer</strong>: Well, eh, how about a little red Leicester.
<br />
<strong>Owner</strong>: I'm, a-fraid we're fresh out of red Leicester, sir.
